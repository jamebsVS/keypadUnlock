# keypadUnlock
Arduino code for a project that combines an LCD, Arduino Micro, electric door strike and a 3x4 keypad to unlock a caravan door after correct 4 character pin entry. 

In the unlikely event that someone actually uses any of the code for this project: I don't care about being credited as the author, just don't take credit yourself if it remains mostly unchanged!

 +Enjoy!
